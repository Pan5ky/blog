You might have heard the term "Learn to Code" recently. Whether it is the CEO of a giant tech company teaching kids how to code, or the former president of the united states telling his nation to learn computer science. Stephen Hawking calling it an essential skill in the 21st century. There has never been more incentive to go into the field of programming as today and while it is true that programming can be very rewarding, it is important to have the right mindset about learning to code. 

# The Expectations #

Tech gets very romantisized by the media. The college student who creates the next big thing and becomes a billionaire. The hacker, who effortlessly breaks into high security systems within minutes. Hyperintelligent beings with a mind, almost unconprehesible for the average human. And while i like the portraying of programmers as these modern day wizards, mainly because it makes me look good, the reality is almost always sobering.

>"The programmers of tomorrow are the wizards of the future. You're going to look like you have magic powers compared to everybody else"
